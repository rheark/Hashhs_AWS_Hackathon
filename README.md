# Resources
The Hashhs team designed a machine learning model using the sentiment twitter kaggle dataset. We also used AWS Comprehend to train Depression Recognizer Model
and Amazon S3 to the host website. 

# About
Our proposal aims to determine the risk of depression through analysing text. This would have significant impacts for psychologists as this could aid in 
early detetction of depression.
